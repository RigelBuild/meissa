// The Renovate preflight's decision core: a pure function over the result of a
// single GitHub GraphQL repo probe, with no I/O, so the whole classification is
// exhaustively unit-testable. The entry point (index.ts) runs the probe via
// `gh` and feeds the result here; the CI job (.github/workflows/renovate.yml)
// runs the entry immediately before `bunx renovate`.
//
// Why this exists: when RENOVATE_TOKEN is expired or lacks access to the repo,
// Renovate's own initRepo fails with the opaque `platform-unknown-error` (it
// only logs the underlying GraphQL error at debug level, which the cron run
// does not capture). This preflight turns that silent, cryptic failure into an
// actionable one-line diagnosis BEFORE Renovate starts, so an unattended cron
// run leaves a log line an operator can act on ("rotate the token", "grant the
// repo") instead of a dead-end error.
